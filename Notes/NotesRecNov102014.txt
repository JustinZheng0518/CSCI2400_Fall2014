	? Float and other Pipelinable things (NOT on a critical path/Dependent): Issue Time / Through-Put Bound
	? Else: Latency
	
	EX of crit path: When the registers can't hold enough variables. Like pointer ex, deref everything

		xmm0 is not on the critical path because it gets reset to 0 at the beginning of the loop, but xmm1
		depends on xmm0, and sums all of them up.
		rdx depends	on rcx, within the comparsion, and is on the critical path because of that.
